JPG to PNG converter project.

This is setup to be run from the command line with two command line parameters, the directory containing the jpg images and the target directory for the png images.

C:\ python3 JPGtoPNGconverter.py \ *jpg dir* \ *target dir*

Updated:
If no command line arguments are given then it will open a file dialog to allow you to select the folders that way.

Will only convert .jpg files so there can be other files in the initial directory without a problem.
